Contributors: onesitedev
Tags: single sign on, SSO, registration, login


## Overview

The ONEsite Drupal plugin allows you to utilize core ONEsite SSO and social technology to extend the capabilities of your Drupal site, easily engage with new users, and create your own vibrant community around your posts.

### Features 

This plugin will override the default login and registration forms and provide a link to launch the ONEsite Social Login modal window. This modal will be responsible for authenticating and registering a user on your site.

 * Give your users a single, seamless, login for all of your sites.
 * Authenticate users via Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, and other OpenID providers.
 * Allow your users to link multiple social accounts to their master account.

### Requirements

No additional software or hardware is required on your Drupal server. However, the plugin does require a valid ONEsite devkey in order to link your Drupal installation to a ONEsite account.

Request your free ONEsite devkey at (http://onesite.com/node/ssoSignup)
